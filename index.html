    <h3>About Electric Cars</h3>
     <p>
      An electric car is a car powered by one or more electric motors with energy from a battery. Electric cars have been around for ninety one years the first one being invented in 1828 by a man by the name of Anyos Jedlik. This early electric car consisted of only an electric motor.  The first modern car was invented by Toyota. electric cars have just become popular because of advances in the battery and desires to reduse green house gas emissions. electric cars are also easily charged, the charging stations can be instaled at home, work, or you can find them at some gas stations.

    <h3>Why Should we Use electric Cars</h3>
    <p>
     Scientists estimate that oil will disapear form earth in 2030, and all natural gasses will run out by 2050 this means that gas cars will not be usable. Electricity on the other hand will never run out due to solar, wind , steam, and biomass power. Did you know that over %75 of all carbon monoxide emitions are produced throught gas powered cars. This number could be greatly decreased if more people used electric cars.

    <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Not only do combustion engins have thermodynamic limits, but they only effectively use 15% of fuel where as electric mototrs effectively use 69-72% of fuel. Electric cars are also more efficient at using stored energy. </p>
